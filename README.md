# Song-Creator
This program will be designed to play songs given note values and times. Note values will be determined by the base case of A4 = 440 Hz and 12 Tone Equal Temperament.

Version 0.1:
Creates the basic framework for notes.
Defines the note as a string.
Defines frequencies of the A notes in every octave.
Can determine a note a half step up/down from another note as long as the frequency is defined for the original note.
TODO: Need to find a way to define the frequency of a note given its name instead of defining it based off the A object.
    Will likely define based off the A frequency in that relative octave. 

Creates the basic framework for the frequency player itself.
Plays a frequency given the note and a duration.

Version 0.2:
Defined comparisons between notes.
TODO is still TODO.
